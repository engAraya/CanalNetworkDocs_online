# Design of Inclined Drops
Introduced Dec,2024.

The design of inclined drops is handles by use of floating nodes, like many other structures in irrigation systems. This include Head and cross regulator structures. The properties and various settings are managed from the floating node, once the node is defined as a structure.

# Assumptions
The following are the key assumptions and limitations of the current release.

- The chute length is hydraulically short. This means, there is no enough length in the glacis for significant head loss to affect the pre-jump flow depth. If this condition is not met, the designed energy desssipation pool will be conservative.

- The canal section upstream and downstream of the drop location are identical in all respects (roughness, side slope, bed slope, discharge, etc...)

- Thickness of various components at Thk= 0.40;

- No Transvverse variation og ground level is considered.


The following features will be included in upcoming versions.
- Quantity estimation
- Type III and Type IV energy dessipators




width reduction vs crest heigh options - to balance hydraulic head at upstream

Type I - USBR Jump
