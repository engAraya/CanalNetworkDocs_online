    Accompanied by **Version V4.8.12** of iCAD Bridge Application.


    > **Important Note:** Make sure AutoCAD is closed before you continue. If not, your update may not work, and require time to sort out. This release contains updates to the ***iCAD Bridge*** application.

2. Start your product, go to `Help > Updates...` Then choose `Manual` option. This will ask to close the application and re-start. Choose `Exit` to agree, and continue.

3. Upon restart, the launcher application will ask if you would like to download or manually update. Choose `Manually`. On the file explorer, point to your downloaded resource file. The rest will be handled by the launcher.


Download the update resources to make your installation uptodate from the linke below.


## What's New
Updated capabilities for this release are documented below.

> :warning: **Important Note:** If your current ***iCAD Bridge Application*** is linked to iCAD application folder, and iCAD is not updated, make sure to relink AutoCAD environment to the *iCAD Bridge.dvb* in CanalNETWORK application folder.

### Drain Network Feature

The new feature is developed and included after the final requirement and review. You can now import a network of drainage canals and design - draw - estiamte.

  The feature is fully functional allowing all subtasks to be handled from one environement - designing and anlysis, technical drawing generation and quantity estimation all from one environment.

  Its easy to use - thanks to the effort made to build on the network processing algorithm used in CanalNETWORK - making the learning curve much steeper. 

  **Try it, you will be surprised!**



### ProfileJET plugin

We have included a plugin application that can be used for quick alingment profile checks for multiple canals.

The application can also be used to interactively view how the profile changes with alignment adjustemnt.

### LiDAR Data Processing
Culminating previous works in to a robust algorithm, we have now released the version capable of handling surveying data from LiDAR (UAV devices) effectively.

Following the development for handling large data sets provisions are made to show progress.

### Improved canal route validation
We have now included an algorithm to automatically detect and remove polylines that self intersect, while importing canal routes to CanalNETWORK environment.

### Alignment Adjustment 
Soft reload tools are now enhanced to allow adjustment of alignments and reloading changes more quickly. This used to be a challenge, when dealing with unavoidable alignment changes during design.

### Bug-fixes
- Data validation for **Construction_Variables** entry is now fixed, correctly identifying array size and data length.
