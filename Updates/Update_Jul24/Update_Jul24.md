## What's New
[Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

Since previous month, we have updates in documentation to capture use cases in detail, and help users better experience the software. These include updates for preview few months as well.

Improvements for the period include the following:

- Better and similar Data tips in plan view, profile view, and detail view axes.

- Included `Refresh Routes` menu for plan view axis. This allows to clear all objects, and recreate only route information in the view. Nodes are now recreated when using the `Show Nodes` context menu.

- The Canal section design interface is updated to ensure designed values from solver are retained on completion. Previously, some solver solutions were volatile.
