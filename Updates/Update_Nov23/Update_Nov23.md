The solution treats canals as networks, similar to the approach implemnted in supply networks. Separate features are built in to the same environment to handle design, drawing and estimation of drainage canal networks.

These will be documented in a separate documentation, that will be available soon.

### Enhanced Data Security
Improvements are included in this release to allow automatic data saving for users arround every 3 minutes. This allows users to backup their work, in case of unexpected conditions (e.g., file corruption or power failure before saving)

### Bug Fixes
- A bug reported when commulating farm block areas is reoslved. This contained exceptional (and rare) similarities in object handles used to represent objects in AutoCAD environemnt. This is succesfully handled in this release of CanalNETWORK application.

- Side slope annotations on Longitudinal profile view axis is now rounded to two decimals (previously rounded to whole number). This also applies to LSec drawings generated to AutoCAD.
